				This app predicts <strong>credit risk</strong> (default vs non-default) for loan applicants using a trained CatBoost model. You provide applicant and loan details; the model returns a binary outcome used for decision support.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Features used include age, income, home ownership, employment length, loan intent, loan grade, loan amount, interest rate, percent of income, prior default flag, and credit history length. The model and encodings are loaded from the <code class="bg-cream px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-sm">models/</code> directory.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				Built with Flask and Tailwind CSS. For setup and run instructions, see the project README.
